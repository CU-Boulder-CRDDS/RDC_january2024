# Introduction

## Description

As data-based research becomes increasingly sophisticated and widespread, skills in data management, data analysis, and computational thinking are growing in importance for applied researchers. This Research Data Camp aims to provide incoming and continuing graduate students with a gentle introduction to data and programming-related research tools that will increase their access to cutting-edge methods as they begin their programs and research. Topics covered include data management and data storage; tools for collaboration and sharing  (using GitHub and GitHub Pages); data discovery; data ethics; data analysis and visualization fundamentals in Python and R; and an overview of data publishing and archiving. 

At the conclusion of the Research Data Camp, participants are invited to earn a microcredential that certifies their understanding of the topics that are covered. We will provide more information about this opportunity on the final day of the Research Data Camp.
