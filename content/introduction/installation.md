# Installation Instructions

In order to follow along with the sessions on R and Python (on Days 2 and 3 respectively), you will need to install relevant applications. Please attempt to complete these installations before the start of the Camp, and let us know on Day 1 if you are having installation issues that we could try to help with. 

## Python Installation Instructions

The Python workshop uses [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), a data science platform which includes all the required software needed for the Python component of this workshop. Please download and install Anaconda in advance of this workshop, accepting the default options during installation.  If you need assistance with this, or just want to meet others planning on attending the Python workshop, please come to the virtual [Python Research Data Camp office hour on Jan 9th at 12pm](https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/ap/t-59584e83/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fteams.microsoft.com%2Fl%2Fmeetup-join%2F19%253ameeting_MGE1ZWQ2Y2EtOGYyOS00NTZhLTg3MTItNmUzNzE1MWYzZjg0%2540thread.v2%2F0%3Fcontext%3D%257b%2522Tid%2522%253a%2522afb58802-ff7a-4bb1-ab21-367ff2ecfc8b%2522%252c%2522Oid%2522%253a%252279cacff0-a5ea-4da8-a062-62cd5f93d651%2522%257d&data=05%7C02%7CAditya.Ranganath%40colorado.edu%7Cfcd2b7802b5c475b965408dc019e5da9%7C3ded8b1b070d462982e4c0b019f46057%7C1%7C0%7C638387026892457868%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=oDiez99tk0VKy4DpYLFvUrVn6Liou21sNLlYHGa4gAI%3D&reserved=0).
